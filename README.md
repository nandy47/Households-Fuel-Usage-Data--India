# Slum-Households-Fuel-Usage-Data--India
You can use this repo to access simple non-formatted csv files of the type of fuel used in slum households in India

The reason for creating this repo is that the Indian datasets have too much pretty formatting and is tough for us to work with. 
Currently, this repo only includes a few states, but I will add more data as soon as possible for me. Additionaly, feel free to contribute, it would be of great help.
